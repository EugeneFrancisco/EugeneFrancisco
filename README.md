I'm a second year math student at Stanford with interests in probability and number theory. I'm very interested in problems of stochastic control and MDPs.

You can find on this page some projects of mine, both from school and from my free time. Most recently, a Brownian motion simulation which models the Ito correction term from Stochastic calculus, particularly applicable to financial derivative pricing or to diffusion systems in physics. 

In my free time, I love learning abstract algebra and graph theory. I also play jazz piano and I rock climb.
